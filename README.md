# Hybrid Energy System Optimization

This machine learning and optimization-based work includes a very comprehensive and detailed approach to grid demand and generation forecasting. This type of work is of great importance in terms of energy management and sustainability. The steps and deliverables you include include the integration and analysis of many different components:

1- Data Analysis and Visualization: You begin by examining the relationships between energy demand and solar and wind energy production. This step helps you understand the overall structure of your data and identify relationships.

2- Forecasting: You predict solar and wind energy production based on historical weather data. This step allows you to plan and manage future energy production.

3- Optimization Strategy: You establish an optimization model that minimizes the cost of produced energy. This step aims to provide economic savings by ensuring optimal use of energy resources.

4- Impact Assessment: You evaluate the reduction in carbon emissions and economic savings achieved with the optimization strategy. This is an important step in terms of sustainability and environmental impacts.

5- Visualization: You visually analyze your model's predictive performance and optimization results. This strengthens understanding and communication of results.

Such studies contribute greatly to making data-driven decisions in the energy sector. Additionally, by applying Python and machine learning techniques to energy management problems, it is used as an effective tool in solving complex issues such as renewable energy integration and grid management.
